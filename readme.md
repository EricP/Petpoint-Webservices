### Setup:

#### Configuring the pages:
You must create three pages, one for Cats, one for Dogs, and one for singular Animals to be viewed. These pages can have any name. For each page, you must enter the "Text" view, and then include the HTML "<div id="animal"></div>". Without this HTML, the pages will fail to load any information.

#### Configuring the settings:
Once you have all three pages prepared, you must update your settings so the plugin knows where they are. Follow the instructions below to do this:
* From the main dashboard, hover over Settings and then select "PP Webservices Settings". 
* Enter the URL for the three pages you made previously into their respective settings boxes.

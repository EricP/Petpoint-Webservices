### Setup:

#### Configuring the pages:
You must create three pages, one for Cats, one for Dogs, and one for singular Animals to be viewed. These pages can have any name. For each page, you must enter the "Text" view, and then include the HTML "<div id="animal"></div>". Without this HTML, the pages will fail to load any information. You can enter in any message you like between the tags, but that text will be removed when the animal's information is loaded. This is a good place to put a message stating that the page requires Javascript to be enabled to function correctly. 

#### Configuring the settings:
Once you have all three pages prepared, you must update your settings so the plugin knows where they are. Follow the instructions below to do this:
* From the main dashboard, hover over Settings and then select "PP Webservices Settings". 
* Enter the URL for the three pages you made previously into their respective settings boxes.
* For the View Animal pages to work correctly, you MUST refresh your Permalink settings. To do this, go to Settings, then Permalinks, and click "Save Changes". You do not need to make any changes to the settings, simply clicking the button will work.
